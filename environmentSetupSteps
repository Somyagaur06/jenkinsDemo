Step 1: Created a Java Project using Eclipse IDE

Step 2:Intialized an new git repository on local system and pushed the code from local repository to Remote github repository:
        1.Open git bash in new folder
        2.git init
        3.git remote add origin "https://github.com/Somyagaur06/DockerDemo.git"
        4.git add -A
        5.git commit -m "adding files"
        6.git push origin master
        
      
      Project is now pushed to https://github.com/Somyagaur06/DockerDemo.git
      
      
      
   Step 3: Jenkins Setup
           1.Jenkins is setup and running on EC2 instance on port 8010
           
           
   
   Step 3: Created a new project in Jenkins to build the project from "https://github.com/Somyagaur06/DockerDemo.git"
           
           1.On any change in files of repository "https://github.com/Somyagaur06/DockerDemo.git" Jenkins will trigger build
           2.Once ,the project is build and packaged run Shell commands to run Dockerfile and build docker image from docker file
           3.Shell commands for building docker image from docker file are:
               1  cd "path to Dockerfile" 
               2.docker build -t "image name" .
               3.docker run  -p <external port>:<container-port> "image name same as given in step 2"
            
              Push Image to Docker Repository
          1.docker login
          2.docker tag <name of image to be tagged> <dockerHub Username>/<image name>
          3.docker push <name of the tagged image to be pushed>
